Python Variables
---

```
In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it.

A variable in Python is like a container that holds data.

ou can store different types of values in a variable, such as numbers or text.
```

```
Example:

x = 5  # x holds the number 5

name = "Alice"  # name holds the text "Alice"


# We don't provide datatype while variable decleration due to dynamic nature of python.
```

```
Rules for Naming Variables:

1. Must start with a letter or underscore (_).

2. Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but cannot start with a number.

3. Variables are case-sensitive, so age and Age are different.
```
