Comments
----

```
Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation[writing extra things inside code that is neglected by language translator].

Comments are notes you add to your code to explain what it does. 

Python ignores comments when running the program, so they are just for the programmer’s reference.
```

Generally Comments in python start with  '#' symbol.

```
Types of Comments

1.Single-line Comment:
  Use the # symbol for a comment on a single line.

  Eg:
    # This is a single-line comment
    x = 5  # This is another comment

2.Multi-line Comment:
  Python doesn’t have a specific syntax for multi-line comments, but you can use triple quotes (''' or """) as a multi-line comment.

  Eg:
    '''
    This is a multi-line comment.
    It spans multiple lines.
    '''

```
