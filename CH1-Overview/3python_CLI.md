The Python Command Line
----

```
[)- Python CLI lets you run small pieces of code quickly without making a full file. You can do things like simple math or test functions instantly.

[)- For example, you can type simple expressions like 1+1 or 3*90, and Python will instantly give you the result.

------------
[)-
To use Python from the command line:

1.Open the terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux).

2.Start Python by typing python (or py on Windows):
        C:\Users\YourName>python
        C:\Users\YourName>py

3.You will be able to see Interactive Mode.

[)-
Interactive Mode:
You can able to type code and see the result immediately in this mode.
It is enabled when we are using Command Line Interface of Python.

Eg:
>>> 1 + 1
2
>>> print("Hello!")
Hello!

[)-
   You can take advantage of python's Command Line in your 'cmd.' or terminal. You can even directly write python small code in this workspace/Command Line.

```
